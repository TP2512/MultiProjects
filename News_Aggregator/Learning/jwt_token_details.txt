In the provided code snippet, the SECRET_KEY variable ("09d25e094faa6ca2556c818166b7a9563b93f7099f6f0f4caa6cf63b88e8d3e7") is used as the private key for encoding JWT tokens.

Here's a breakdown:

Private Key:

In JWT-based authentication systems, the private key is used to sign the tokens during their creation. This signature is later used by the server to verify the authenticity and integrity of the tokens.
The private key must remain secret and should only be known to the server or the party responsible for issuing the tokens.
In the provided code, the SECRET_KEY variable is used as the private key to sign the JWT tokens (encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)).
Public Key:

In asymmetric cryptography, which is commonly used with JWT, a corresponding public key is used to verify the signature of the tokens.
However, in the provided code, there's no usage of a public key for verification. Instead, the token is decoded and verified using the same private key (SECRET_KEY) that was used for encoding.
If you want to use public-key cryptography for token verification, you'd typically need to share the public key with the parties that will be verifying the tokens. Then, they can use this public key to validate the signature and ensure the token's authenticity.
In this code snippet, the authentication system relies solely on the SECRET_KEY (private key) to both encode and decode the JWT tokens. This approach is known as symmetric-key cryptography, where the same key is used for both encoding and decoding. However, for added security, you might consider using asymmetric-key cryptography, where a separate public key is used for token verification.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a method for representing claims securely between two parties. They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header and payload are JSON objects that are base64url encoded and are separated by a dot. The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token.

Public-key cryptography is commonly used for JWT tokenization to ensure secure communication between parties. Here's how the process typically works with public and private keys:

Generating Keys:

A pair of cryptographic keys is generated â€“ a public key and a private key.
The private key is kept secret and is known only to the issuer of the JWT.
The public key is shared with anyone who needs to verify the JWT signature.
Token Creation:

The issuer creates a JWT token.
The header and payload are JSON objects containing information about the token, such as the type of token and the claims.
The header and payload are base64url encoded to form the first two parts of the JWT.
The signature is generated by hashing the base64url encoded header and payload along with the private key using a cryptographic algorithm (e.g., HMAC, RSA).
The signature is then appended as the third part of the JWT.
Token Verification:

When a recipient receives the JWT token, they decode the token to extract the header, payload, and signature.
The recipient then computes a new signature by hashing the base64url encoded header and payload using the same algorithm and the public key.
The recipient compares the computed signature with the signature extracted from the JWT. If they match, the token is considered valid.
