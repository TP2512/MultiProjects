Log streaming refers to the practice of sending log messages directly to the standard output (stdout) or standard error (stderr) streams instead of writing them to log files. In a containerized environment, logs streamed to stdout and stderr are captured by the Docker logging system and can be managed using Docker's logging drivers.

Here's how you can implement log streaming in your Python application:

python
Copy code
import logging
import sys

def configure_logger():
    # Create logger
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Set logging level
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    # Create a StreamHandler to stream logs to stdout
    stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)

    # Set formatter
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    stream_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    # Add stream handler to logger
    logger.addHandler(stream_handler)

    return logger

# Usage example
logger = configure_logger()
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
In this example:

The configure_logger function sets up a logger that streams log messages to stdout using a StreamHandler.
The StreamHandler is configured to use the sys.stdout stream to write log messages.
Log messages are formatted using a specified format, including the timestamp, log level, and message.
The logger is then used to log messages at different levels (debug, info, warning, error, critical).
When you run your Python application in a Docker container, the log messages generated by your application will be streamed to stdout. Docker captures these logs and forwards them to the configured logging driver, allowing you to view and manage the logs using Docker commands (docker logs, etc.) or integrate with external logging systems.
