Authentication and authorization are two related but distinct concepts in the context of security:

Authentication:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be before granting access to resources or functionalities. Authentication typically involves presenting credentials, such as usernames and passwords, tokens, biometric data, or certificates, to a system. The system then validates these credentials against stored credentials or an authentication provider to determine if the user is authenticated.

Authorization:
Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user or entity is allowed to access or perform. Once a user is authenticated, authorization defines the permissions and privileges associated with the user's identity. Authorization involves checking whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a resource, perform a specific action, or execute a particular operation. Authorization is often based on roles, groups, or policies defined within the system.

In summary, authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization determines what the authenticated user is allowed to do or access. Authentication precedes authorization, as users must first authenticate themselves before their permissions and privileges can be determined. Together, authentication and authorization play crucial roles in ensuring the security and integrity of systems and applications by controlling access to resources and functionalities based on the identity and permissions of users.
