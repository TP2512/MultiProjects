To authorize some users to access certain APIs while denying access to others, you can implement role-based access control (RBAC) in your FastAPI application. Here's a basic approach to achieve this:

Define User Roles: Define roles for your users, such as "admin", "user", "guest", etc. Each role will have different levels of access to your APIs.

Implement Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms in your FastAPI application to verify the identity of users. This can be done using OAuth2, JWT, or any other authentication method.

Store User Roles: Store the roles of users in your database or any other storage mechanism. Associate each user with one or more roles.

Authorize Access: Implement authorization logic in your API endpoints to check if the authenticated user has the required role(s) to access the endpoint. You can use FastAPI's Depends decorator to inject an authorization dependency into your route handlers.

Secure Endpoints: Secure your API endpoints by requiring users to have specific roles to access them. You can do this by defining custom dependency functions that check the user's roles.

Here's a simplified example of how you can implement RBAC in FastAPI:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException

# Define roles (this can be retrieved from your database)
user_roles = {
    "user1": ["admin"],
    "user2": ["user"],
}

app = FastAPI()

# Custom dependency to check if user is authorized
def is_authorized(user: str = Depends(get_current_user), required_roles: list = []):
    user_role = user_roles.get(user)
    if not user_role or not any(role in user_role for role in required_roles):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Forbidden")
    return user

# Mock function to get current user (you should implement this based on your authentication mechanism)
def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(get_token)):
    return "user1"  # Example: Return current user based on authentication token

# Example API endpoint that requires "admin" role
@app.get("/admin")
async def admin_endpoint(current_user: str = Depends(is_authorized, required_roles=["admin"])):
    return {"message": "Hello Admin"}

# Example API endpoint that requires "user" role
@app.get("/user")
async def user_endpoint(current_user: str = Depends(is_authorized, required_roles=["user"])):
    return {"message": "Hello User"}
In this example:

We define user roles (user_roles) and associate each user with one or more roles.
We define a custom dependency function (is_authorized) that checks if the current user has the required role(s) to access an endpoint.
We secure our API endpoints by requiring specific roles using the Depends decorator with our custom dependency function.
Users who don't have the required role(s) will receive a 403 Forbidden response when trying to access protected endpoints.
