To share serialized data between microservices and obtain results, you typically use HTTP requests to communicate between services. Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this:

Sending Data: In your sender microservice, you serialize the data (e.g., using JSON) and include it in the payload of an HTTP request. You send this request to the endpoint of the receiver microservice.

Receiving Data: In your receiver microservice, you receive the HTTP request, extract the serialized data from the request payload, and deserialize it back into the original data structure (e.g., a Python dictionary).

Processing: You process the data in the receiver microservice as needed. This could involve performing some computations, applying business logic, or any other task relevant to your application.

Sending Response: After processing the data, you may generate a response. This could be a result, an acknowledgment, or any other information. You serialize this response and send it back to the sender microservice in the HTTP response payload.

Handling Response: In the sender microservice, you receive the HTTP response, extract the serialized response data, deserialize it, and handle it appropriately.

Here's a simplified example in Python using the requests library for sending and receiving HTTP requests:

Sender Microservice:

python code:

import requests
import json

# Sample data
data = {"key": "value"}

# Serialize data to JSON
serialized_data = json.dumps(data)

# Send HTTP request to receiver microservice
response = requests.post('http://receiver-service-url', json=serialized_data)

# Handle response
response_data = json.loads(response.text)
print("Received response:", response_data)
Receiver Microservice:

python code:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def process_request():
    # Extract serialized data from request
    serialized_data = request.json

    # Deserialize data
    data = json.loads(serialized_data)

    # Process data
    # Example: Perform some computation
    result = {"result": data["key"].upper()}

    # Serialize response data
    serialized_response = json.dumps(result)

    # Send response
    return serialized_response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
In this example, the sender microservice sends a POST request containing serialized data to the receiver microservice. The receiver microservice deserializes the data, processes it, and sends back a response with the result. The sender microservice then deserializes the response and handles it accordingly.
