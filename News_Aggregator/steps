Project Title: Automated News Aggregator

Project Description:
Develop a web application that aggregates news articles from various sources, performs sentiment analysis on the articles, and presents the results to users. The application will have the following features:

Web Scraping: Implement web scraping to fetch news articles from popular news websites like CNN, BBC, and New York Times. You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for this task.

Data Storage: Store the scraped articles in a MongoDB database to ensure efficient data retrieval and management.

FastAPI Backend: Develop a FastAPI backend to handle user requests and interact with the MongoDB database. Implement endpoints for fetching news articles, performing sentiment analysis, and providing insights.

Sentiment Analysis: Utilize data science techniques and libraries (such as NLTK or TextBlob) to perform sentiment analysis on the news articles. Classify articles as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content.

Frontend Interface: Create a user-friendly frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to search for news articles and view sentiment analysis results.

Automated Testing: Implement automated tests using Robot Framework to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. Write test cases to validate backend API endpoints, database interactions, and frontend functionality.

Docker Containerization: Containerize the application components using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment.

Deployment on Cloud: Deploy the containerized application on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Utilize container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling the application.

Skills Learned:

Web scraping techniques for data extraction.
Backend development using FastAPI and MongoDB.
Sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) libraries.
Frontend development for data visualization and user interaction.
Automated testing with Robot Framework for ensuring application quality.
Containerization with Docker for packaging and deployment.
Cloud deployment and container orchestration using Kubernetes.


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Remove any HTML tags, special characters, or irrelevant information from the scraped data.
Tokenize the text into words or subwords.
Remove stopwords (commonly occurring words like "the", "is", "and") as they don't add much meaning.
Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), or spaCy for these tasks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Check the distribution of categories to ensure a balanced dataset.
Analyze the length of articles to understand their variability.
Visualize the data using histograms, bar charts, or word clouds.
Identify any patterns or anomalies that may affect the analysis.
Feature Engineering:

Extract features from the preprocessed text data that can be used for sentiment analysis.
Common techniques include Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT).
Convert the text data into numerical vectors that machine learning models can understand.
Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for sentiment analysis.
For a beginner-friendly approach, you can start with simple models like logistic regression or Naive Bayes classifiers.
As you gain more experience, you can explore more complex models such as support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformer-based models like BERT.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).
Train the selected model on the training data.
Monitor the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization) as needed to improve performance.
Avoid overfitting by regularizing the model or using techniques like early stopping.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance on unseen data.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC.
Compare the model's performance against baseline models or other approaches to validate its effectiveness.
Fine-Tuning and Iteration:

Fine-tune the selected model further if necessary based on insights gained during evaluation.
Experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature representations, or model architectures to improve performance.
Iterate on the modeling process by refining the model and evaluating its performance iteratively.
Deployment:

Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used for sentiment analysis in real-time.
Build a web application, API, or integrate the model into an existing system to make it accessible to users.
Ensure scalability, reliability, and security of the deployed model.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor the model's performance in production to detect any issues or drift in performance.
Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
Update the model periodically with fresh data or retrain it with new techniques to maintain its effectiveness over time.
Feedback and Iteration:

Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to understand their needs and preferences.
Incorporate user feedback and domain knowledge to refine the model and improve its accuracy and relevance.
Iterate on the modeling process based on feedback and insights gained from real-world usage.
